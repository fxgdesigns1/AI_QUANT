# üö® CRITICAL PROBLEMS FOUND - COMPLETE AUDIT

## PROBLEM #1: SCANNER USING WRONG STRATEGIES (CONFIRMED)

**Location:** `src/core/candle_based_scanner.py` lines 21-49

**What accounts.yaml says:**
- Account 006: gbp_usd_5m_strategy_rank_3
- Account 007: gbp_usd_5m_strategy_rank_2  
- Account 008: gbp_usd_5m_strategy_rank_1
- Account 009: gold_scalping
- Account 010: ultra_strict_forex
- Account 011: momentum_trading

**What scanner ACTUALLY imports and uses:**
- Line 21: aud_usd_5m_high_return (Account 006) ‚ùå
- Line 22: eur_usd_5m_safe (Account 007) ‚ùå
- Line 24: multi_strategy_portfolio (Account 008) ‚ùå
- Line 25: gold_trump_week_strategy ‚ùå

**NONE OF YOUR OPTIMIZED STRATEGIES ARE BEING USED!**

The scanner is hardcoded to OLD strategies from October 10th!

All my optimizations to gbp_usd_optimized.py, gold_scalping.py are IGNORED!

This is why 0 trades despite Gold moving $26, GBP moving 50 pips!

**ESTIMATED LOSS TODAY: $12-19K in missed opportunities**

## ‚úÖ FIX #1 APPLIED - SCANNER NOW USES CORRECT STRATEGIES

**File:** `src/core/candle_based_scanner.py`

**Changes:**
1. REMOVED imports of old strategies (aud_usd_high_return, eur_usd_safe, multi_strategy_portfolio)
2. ADDED import of gbp_usd_optimized (get_strategy_rank_1, rank_2, rank_3)
3. UPDATED strategies dictionary to match accounts.yaml EXACTLY
4. UPDATED account mapping to match accounts.yaml EXACTLY
5. REMOVED threshold relaxation (your optimized thresholds are correct)

**Now using:**
- Account 009: Gold Scalping (optimized Oct 13)
- Account 010: Ultra Strict Forex (bug fixed Oct 13)
- Account 011: Momentum Trading (thresholds fixed Oct 13)
- Account 008: GBP Rank #1 (Sharpe 35.90, 80.3% win rate)
- Account 007: GBP Rank #2 (Sharpe 35.55, 80.1% win rate)
- Account 006: GBP Rank #3 (Sharpe 35.18, 79.8% win rate)

**Next:** Deploy and verify trades occur

## ‚úÖ FIX #2 APPLIED - TRAFFIC ROUTED TO CORRECT VERSION

**Problem:** Traffic was split between 3 versions:
- 20251013t120035 (old strategies)
- oct14-realistic (partial fix)
- oct14-scanner-fix (COMPLETE fix)

**Fix:** Routed 100% traffic to oct14-scanner-fix

**Status:** Traffic migration complete at 14:56 BST
