## 📂 Credentials Location

Your sensitive data will be stored in:
```
/Users/mac/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-fxgdesigns1@gmail.com/My Drive/AI Trading/Gits/AI_QUANT_credentials/
```

✅ **Already created** and ready to use!  
📁 **Open it:** Run this command:
```bash
open "/Users/mac/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-fxgdesigns1@gmail.com/My Drive/AI Trading/Gits/AI_QUANT_credentials"
```

---

## ⚡ NEXT STEPS (Copy & Paste These Commands)

### Step 1: Wait for Xcode Installation

The Xcode Command Line Tools installation dialog should have appeared.
**Click "Install"** and wait 5-10 minutes.

To check if it's done:
```bash
git --version
```
If you see a version number (not an error), you're ready!

---

### Step 2: Run the AI_QUANT Setup Script

Once Xcode is installed, run:

```bash
cd /Users/mac/quant_system_clean
./SETUP_AI_QUANT.sh
```

**This script does EVERYTHING:**
- ✅ Configures Git with your email (fxgdesigns1@gmail.com)
- ✅ Creates Google Drive credentials folder
- ✅ Sets up symbolic links for secure credential access
- ✅ Runs security checks
- ✅ Stages files for commit
- ✅ Creates your first commit
- ✅ Configures GitHub remote to AI_QUANT
- ✅ Guides you through pushing to GitHub

**Total time:** 5 minutes

---

### Step 3: Create GitHub Repository

When the script prompts you:

1. Go to **https://github.com**
2. Click **"+"** → **"New repository"**
3. Repository name: **`AI_QUANT`**
4. Owner: **`fxgdesigns1`** (or your username)
5. Description: "AI-powered quantitative trading system"
6. Visibility: **Private** ✅ (recommended)
7. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README"
8. Click **"Create repository"**

---

### Step 4: Get Personal Access Token

You'll need this to push to GitHub:

1. Go to **https://github.com/settings/tokens**
2. Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Name it: **"AI_QUANT Access"**
4. Expiration: **No expiration** (or choose your preference)
5. Check the **`repo`** scope (full control of private repositories)
6. Click **"Generate token"**
7. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)
8. Save it somewhere safe

---

### Step 5: Push to GitHub

The script will prompt you. When ready:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted for credentials:
- **Username:** `fxgdesigns1` (or your GitHub username)
- **Password:** Paste the **Personal Access Token** (not your GitHub password)

---

### Step 6: Edit Your Credentials

After pushing to GitHub, add your OANDA credentials:

```bash
open "/Users/mac/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-fxgdesigns1@gmail.com/My Drive/AI Trading/Gits/AI_QUANT_credentials/accounts.yaml"
```

Replace all placeholders with your actual:
- OANDA account IDs
- OANDA API keys
- Risk settings
- Instruments you want to trade

**Save the file** - it will sync via Google Drive automatically!

---

### Step 7: Test the System

```bash
cd google-cloud-trading-system
python3 src/main.py --test
```

If everything is configured correctly:
- ✅ OANDA connection successful
- ✅ Accounts loaded
- ✅ Strategies initialized

---

## 🎉 Success Indicators

Once everything is done, verify:

### On GitHub:
1. Go to https://github.com/fxgdesigns1/AI_QUANT
2. ✅ All files visible
3. ✅ `README.md` displays nicely
4. ✅ `accounts.yaml.template` is there
5. ❌ `accounts.yaml` is **NOT** there (protected!)
6. ❌ No API keys or credentials visible

### In Google Drive:
```bash
ls -la "/Users/mac/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-fxgdesigns1@gmail.com/My Drive/AI Trading/Gits/AI_QUANT_credentials/"
```
Should show:
- ✅ `accounts.yaml` (your actual credentials)
- ✅ `README.md` (documentation)

### In Your Project:
```bash
ls -la google-cloud-trading-system/accounts.yaml
```
Should show:
- ✅ Symbolic link → pointing to Google Drive folder

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Xcode tools still not working"

Check installation:
```bash
xcode-select -p
```

If it shows a path like `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`, it's installed!

Still not working? Try:
```bash
sudo xcode-select --reset
xcode-select --install
```

---

### "Can't find credentials file"

Verify Google Drive is syncing:
```bash
open "/Users/mac/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-fxgdesigns1@gmail.com/My Drive/AI Trading/Gits/"
```

If the folder is empty:
1. Check Google Drive app is running
2. Check internet connection
3. Make folder "Available offline"

---

### "Symlink broken"

Recreate it:
```bash
cd /Users/mac/quant_system_clean
./SETUP_AI_QUANT.sh
```

---

### "Permission denied to GitHub"

You need a Personal Access Token (see Step 4 above).

Don't use your GitHub password - it won't work!

---

### "GitHub repository already exists"

That's fine! The script will update the remote URL to point to it.

Just continue with pushing.

---
