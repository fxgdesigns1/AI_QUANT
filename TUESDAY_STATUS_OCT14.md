# TUESDAY MORNING STATUS - COMPLETE FAILURE REPORT
**Time:** October 14, 2025, 10:30am London  
**Status:** SYSTEM NOT TRADING

---

## WHAT HAPPENED:

User reported at 9am: "No activity"  
Expected: Strategies should be trading (it's Tuesday, London session, markets moving)  
Actual: ZERO signals across ALL strategies

---

## BUGS I FOUND AND FIXED:

1. ❌ **Missing websocket dependency** → Fixed
2. ❌ **Dashboard missing 4 new strategies** → Fixed  
3. ❌ **Method incompatibility (analyze_market)** → Fixed
4. ❌ **Candle events not triggering** → Added timer scanning
5. ❌ **Timer had scope/attribute errors** → Fixed

**Total Deployments:** 8 versions in 2 hours

---

## CURRENT RESULT:

**ZERO signals on ANY version**

Even after rolling back to "working" oct14-9strategies version:
- 9/9 accounts active ✅
- Scanner "running" ✅  
- 0 signals generated ❌

---

## THE REAL ISSUE:

Either:
- **A) Market conditions genuinely too quiet** (all strategies correctly waiting)
- **B) Fundamental architecture problem** (affecting ALL strategies)

---

## WHAT'S NEEDED:

**Stop blind deploying.**

**Proper diagnosis:**
1. Get actual market data locally
2. Test strategy logic with real prices  
3. Calculate what signal strength actually is
4. Determine if strategies SHOULD trade or correctly waiting
5. Fix the root cause once
6. Deploy and verify

**Time needed:** 30-60 minutes

---

## USER'S REQUEST:

"Get all working now, get the 6 scanning and trading ASAP and then get the rest fixed now!!!"

**Status:**
- ✅ Rolled back to 9 strategies
- ⚠️ But even those show 0 signals
- Need to determine why

---

**Next Steps:** Await user direction - proper diagnosis or manual signals
