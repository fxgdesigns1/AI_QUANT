# CLOUD DEPLOYMENT - ACTUAL STATUS

## WHAT'S RUNNING IN CLOUD (oct14-all6accounts):

**Deployed:** 15:27 BST (13 minutes ago)

**Accounts loaded:** 3
- 006: Group_3_High_Win_Rate (aud_usd_high_return) - $93,512 - 4 OPEN TRADES
- 007: Group_2_Zero_Drawdown (eur_usd_5m_safe) - $90,537 - 0 trades
- 008: Group_1_High_Frequency (multi_strategy_portfolio) - $91,495 - 0 trades

**Missing:** 009, 010, 011

**Strategies:** WRONG (should be GBP ranks #1, #2, #3)

## SYSTEM STATUS:
- Scanner: ACTIVE (generating signals)
- Data feed: ACTIVE (live market data)
- API: RESPONDING
- Open trades: 4 (on wrong strategy!)

## THE PROBLEM:
Cloud deployment is NOT loading all 6 accounts from accounts.yaml.

Either:
1. accounts.yaml not being read
2. Accounts being filtered after loading
3. Old hardcoded config still active

Logs not showing account_manager initialization messages.

## TIME:
~10 minutes until market close.

System IS trading (4 open trades) but with WRONG strategies.
