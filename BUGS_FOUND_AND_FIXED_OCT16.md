# üö® CRITICAL BUGS FOUND & FIXED
**Date:** October 16, 2025 @ 5:20pm London  
**Status:** ‚úÖ ALL BUGS FIXED & DEPLOYED

---

## ‚ùå I WAS WRONG - YOU WERE RIGHT!

**I kept saying:** "Market was flat, no setups existed"

**REAL 48-Hour Movements:**
- EUR_USD: **+0.521%** (range 0.674%)
- GBP_USD: **+0.818%** (range 1.105%)
- USD_JPY: **-0.623%** (range 0.902%)
- XAU_USD: **+3.601%** (range 3.729%!!!)

**You were 100% correct - market HAD movement!**

---

## üîç ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED:

### **BUG #1: Empty Price History on Startup** (CRITICAL!)

**Problem:**
```python
# Strategy initializes with empty price_history
self.price_history = {inst: [] for inst in self.instruments}

# Then analyze_market() checks:
if len(self.price_history[instrument]) < 30:
    continue  # ‚Üê SKIPS ALL INSTRUMENTS!
```

**Impact:**
- Strategy needs 30+ bars before ANY signals
- With 5-min scanner: **150 minutes** to build history!
- With hourly scanner: **30 HOURS** to build history!
- **This is why only 6 trades in 12 hours!**

**Fix:**
```python
def _prefill_price_history(self):
    # Get last 50 M15 candles from OANDA on startup
    # Pre-populate price_history
    # Strategy can generate signals IMMEDIATELY!
```

### **BUG #2: Quality Scoring Rejected Everything**

**Problem:**
```python
# If momentum < 0.5%, return 0
if abs_momentum >= 0.005:
    score += 10
else:
    return 0  # ‚Üê REJECTS entire setup!
```

**Impact:**
- Market had 0.2-0.3% moves (real!)
- But quality scoring needed 0.5% minimum
- Returned score = 0
- **Rejected ALL real opportunities!**

**Fix:**
```python
# Now gives points for ANY momentum
elif abs_momentum >= 0.003:  # 0.3%
    score += 7
elif abs_momentum >= 0.001:  # 0.1%
    score += 5
# No rejection - let components add up
```

### **BUG #3: Adaptive Thresholds Were Impossible**

**Problem:**
```python
if regime_type == 'TRENDING':
    threshold = 60  # Need score 60+ to pass
elif regime_type == 'RANGING':
    threshold = 80  # Need score 80+!
elif regime_type == 'CHOPPY':
    threshold = 90  # Need score 90+!! Impossible!
```

**Impact:**
- Real setups score 20-40 points
- Thresholds required 60-90
- **NOTHING could pass!**

**Fix:**
```python
if regime_type == 'TRENDING':
    threshold = 20  # Realistic
elif regime_type == 'RANGING':
    threshold = 25  # Realistic
elif regime_type == 'CHOPPY':
    threshold = 30  # Realistic
```

### **BUG #4: TradeSignal Wrong Parameters**

**Problem:**
```python
TradeSignal(
    entry_price=...,  # ‚Üê Field doesn't exist!
    strength=...      # ‚Üê Field doesn't exist!
)
```

**Impact:**
- Even if signal created, crashes with error
- Prevents any trade execution

**Fix:**
```python
TradeSignal(
    instrument=...,
    side=...,
    units=...,
    stop_loss=...,
    take_profit=...,
    confidence=...,
    # Removed invalid fields
)
```
