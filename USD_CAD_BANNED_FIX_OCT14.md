**Date:** October 14, 2025 - 14:30 BST  
**Status:** FIXED & DEPLOYED ‚úÖ

## üö® PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

**Critical Configuration Error Found:**

Line 28 of `accounts.yaml` stated:
```yaml
# Instruments to trade (USD_CAD GLOBALLY BANNED - Lost $8K+ fighting uptrend)
```

**BUT** USD_CAD was still enabled in **4 accounts:**

1. ‚ùå **Account 010** (Line 59) - Ultra Strict Forex - `USD_CAD`
2. ‚ùå **Account 011** (Line 88) - Momentum Multi-Pair - `USD_CAD`
3. ‚ùå **Account 004** (Line 261) - Ultra Strict V2 - `USD_CAD`
4. ‚ùå **Account 003** (Line 286) - Momentum V2 - `USD_CAD`

### **Why This Was Dangerous:**

- USD_CAD lost $8K+ fighting an uptrend previously
- Comment said it was "GLOBALLY BANNED"
- But 4 accounts could still trade it
- Risk of repeating yesterday's losses
- Contradicted the ban decision
