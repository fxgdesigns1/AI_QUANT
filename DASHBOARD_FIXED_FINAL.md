## Date: October 21, 2025, 12:24 PM

## Summary
Successfully fixed the dashboard to display working data in the beautiful original design with improved text legibility.

---

## âœ… What Was Fixed

### 1. Trading Signals Display
**Problem:** JavaScript was looking for complex API fields that didn't exist
**Solution:** Simplified the `createOpportunityCard()` function to work with the actual API response format

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `/Users/mac/quant_system_clean/templates/dashboard_advanced.html`
- Modified JavaScript to use `opp.pair` instead of `opp.instrument`
- Modified JavaScript to use `opp.signal` instead of `opp.direction`
- Simplified card HTML to display only available fields:
  - Entry Price, Stop Loss, Take Profit, Confidence
  - Risk/Reward Ratio, Quality Score
  - Strategy name and Signal reason

### 2. Text Legibility
**Problem:** Gray text (#999) on dark background was hard to read
**Solution:** Updated all gray color values to lighter shades

**Changes Made:**
- Changed `--text-muted` from `#b0b0b0` to `#d0d0d0`
- Changed `.detail-label` color from `#b0b0b0` to `#d0d0d0`
- Updated all inline `color: #999` to `color: #d0d0d0` in the opportunity card

### 3. Dashboard Backend
**Running:** `working_beautiful_dashboard.py` on port 8080
**Template:** `/Users/mac/quant_system_clean/templates/dashboard_advanced.html`
