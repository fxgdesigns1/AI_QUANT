## 🥇 GOLD'S SMALL TARGETS PHILOSOPHY (Now Universal)

### **Why Small Targets Win:**

**Example: Gold Trade**

**Big Target Approach (Old):**
```
Entry: Buy Gold
Target: +100 pips
Reality: Hit +90 pips → reverses → -20 pips ❌
Result: Frustration
```

**Small Target Approach (Gold):**
```
Entry: Buy Gold
Target 1: +15 pips → Take 30% = Secured!
Target 2: +30 pips → Take 30% = Secured!
Target 3: +50 pips → Take 20% = Secured!
Trail: Last 20%

Reality: Hit +90 pips peak
Result: Secured $2,700 + trail $180 = $2,880 total ✅
Even if reverses completely, you keep $2,700!
```

**Applied to ALL instruments now!**
