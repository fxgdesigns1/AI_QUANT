## 🐛 BUGS IDENTIFIED & FIXED

### **1. ✅ Market Report Sent to Telegram**

**Issue:** User requested market report for today via Telegram

**Fix Applied:**
- Created comprehensive market report script
- Includes live OANDA price data
- Portfolio status, trading plan, and market analysis
- **Sent successfully to Telegram** (Chat ID: 6100678501)

**File:** `/Users/mac/quant_system_clean/send_market_report.py`

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

### **2. ✅ Daily Telegram Updates Missing**

**Issue:** No morning briefing (6:00 AM) or evening summary (9:30 PM) being sent automatically

**Fix Applied:**
- Created daily updates scheduler: `start_daily_telegram_updates.py`
- Automated morning briefing at 6:00 AM London
- Automated evening summary at 9:30 PM London
- Scheduler now running in background (PID: 98134)
- Logs to: `logs/daily_telegram_updates.log`

**Schedule:**
- 🌅 **6:00 AM:** Morning briefing (portfolio status, today's plan, market conditions)
- 🌙 **9:30 PM:** Evening summary (today's results, P/L, weekly progress)

**Status:** ✅ RUNNING

---

### **3. ✅ Configuration Mismatch (Cloud vs Local)**

**Issue:** Local `oanda_config.env` referenced accounts 009-011, but cloud deployment (`app.yaml`) was using accounts 006-008

**Problem Details:**
- Local config: 009 (Primary), 010 (Gold), 011 (Alpha)
- Cloud config: 008 (Primary), 007 (Gold), 006 (Alpha)
- This created confusion about which accounts were actually trading

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `oanda_config.env` to match cloud deployment
- Now both configurations reference accounts 006-008
- Strategies aligned:
  - **008:** Multi-Strategy Portfolio (GBP/USD, NZD/USD, Gold)
  - **007:** Ultra Strict Forex (GBP/USD, Gold)
  - **006:** Momentum Trading (EUR/JPY, USD/CAD)

**File Updated:** `/Users/mac/quant_system_clean/google-cloud-trading-system/oanda_config.env`

**Status:** ✅ SYNCED

---

### **4. ✅ Stuck Local Process Removed**

**Issue:** `shadow_dashboard.py` (PID 18740) consuming 99.9% CPU in infinite loop

**Fix Applied:**
- Process terminated (kill -9 18740)
- CPU usage reduced significantly
- System now runs cleaner

**Status:** ✅ REMOVED
