## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### **What's Integrated:**
- ✅ Scheduled scanners with contextual analysis
- ✅ Enhanced morning scanner
- ✅ Daily monitoring and Telegram alerts
- ✅ Profit protection and regime detection (momentum strategy)
- ✅ Price history pre-fill (momentum strategy)

### **What's NOT Yet Integrated:**
- ⚠️ Contextual modules NOT in actual trading strategies
- ⚠️ Quality scoring NOT used by strategy decision-making
- ⚠️ Session manager NOT checked by strategies
- ⚠️ Monte Carlo optimization incomplete (28% done)

**Reality:** The scheduled scanner will send you quality opportunities via Telegram, but the strategies themselves still use their original logic without contextual filtering.

**This is still a major upgrade** because:
- You get automated opportunity scanning
- Quality filtering before Telegram alerts
- Better timing (session-aware scanning)
- More context in alerts

But for **full contextual trading**, strategies need the modules integrated (next phase).

## 📊 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

### **Starting Tomorrow:**
1. **6:00 AM:** Telegram pre-market briefing
2. **8:00 AM:** Morning opportunities scan
3. **1:00 PM:** Peak time scan (best liquidity)
4. **5:00 PM:** End of day review
5. **9:00 PM:** Asian session preview

### **Manual Scanning:**
```bash
cd /Users/mac/quant_system_clean/google-cloud-trading-system
python3 scan_now.py
```

### **Trading Behavior:**
- Strategies continue with existing logic
- Automated scanning provides manual trade ideas
- Quality threshold: 50+ for Telegram alerts
- Weekend: No trading (markets closed)
