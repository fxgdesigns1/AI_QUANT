# DUPLICATE/CONFUSING FILES TO REMOVE

## Duplicate Account Manager (CAUSING TODAY'S DISASTER):
src/core/account_manager.py - DELETE (old hardcoded version)
âœ… KEEP: src/core/dynamic_account_manager.py (YAML loader - WORKING NOW)

## Old Backup Directories (Confusing):
clean_deploy/ - DELETE (old backup, not used)
cloud_run_deploy/ - DELETE (old backup, not used)
minimal_deploy/ - DELETE (old backup, not used)

## Will NOT delete these (keep for analysis):
analytics/ - Keep (separate analytics system)
temp_backup/ - Keep (actual backups)
logs/ - Keep (logs for debugging)

Total removal: ~3 duplicate directories + 1 duplicate file
Result: Crystal clear single account manager system
