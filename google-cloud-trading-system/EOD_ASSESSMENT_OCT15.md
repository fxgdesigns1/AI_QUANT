- High RR ratios ‚úì

### ‚úÖ AUTONOMOUS OPERATION

- No manual intervention needed
- Proved system can run while laptop closed

**Key Success:**

---

## ‚ùå WHAT DIDN'T WORK

### ‚ùå GOLD TRUMP (Account 009)
**Performance:** -$3,858 (-3.86%)

**Why It Failed:**
- Gold barely moved ($28 range, not $50+)
- CPI affected USD pairs more than Gold
- Wrong strategy for this event type
- Gold-specific strategy needs Gold-specific volatility

**Mistakes:**
- Assumed all CPI = big Gold moves
- Didn't have USD-focused backup
- Too Gold-dependent

### ‚ùå OVERTRADING (Before Fixes)
**Problem:** 41 trades in one day (too many)

**Issues:**
- Scalping frequency (every 3 min) = overtrading
- No daily limits = quantity over quality
- 29% win rate from overtrading

**Fixed:**
- Daily limits: 1-3 trades per strategy
- Scan frequency: 15 minutes (swing)
- Quality over quantity focus

### ‚ùå AGGRESSIVE SCANNER
**Problem:** False alerts, margin issues

**Issues:**
- Sent Telegram alerts before verifying trades
- Position sizing too large (1M units)
- Destroyed trust with false "ENTRY!" messages

**Fixed:**
- Verify on OANDA before alerting
- Reduced to 500k units
- Eventually stopped (too aggressive)

**Changes Needed:**
1. **Add USD pair backup**
   - Trade EUR/USD, GBP/USD when Gold quiet
   - Don't sit idle on low Gold volatility days
   - Hybrid: Gold primary, USD secondary

2. **Event-type detection**
   ```yaml
   if event_type == 'USD_INFLATION':
       focus: ['EUR_USD', 'GBP_USD']  # USD moves more than Gold
   elif event_type == 'GEOPOLITICAL':
       focus: ['XAU_USD']  # Gold safe haven
   ```

3. **Zone auto-update**
   - Update zones every Monday based on current price
   - ¬±$50 from current price
   - Auto-adjust, not hardcoded

### Momentum Multi-Pair (011) - Scale This!

**Current:** +$19,620 (best performer)

**Changes to Scale:**

### Ultra Strategies (004, 005) - Too Strict?

**Issue:**

- May be TOO selective OR wrong criteria

**Improvements:**

2. **Lower to 90% confidence temporarily**
   - Test if this improves results
   - May be missing good trades

3. **Focus on fewer pairs**
   - Instead of 4 pairs, focus on 1-2 best
   - Become TRUE specialist
