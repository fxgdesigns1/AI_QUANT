# 14-Day Backtest Results Summary

## ❌ CRITICAL FINDINGS - ALL STRATEGIES FAILED THE 50% WIN RATE THRESHOLD

### Trump DNA (Momentum Trading)
- **Total Trades**: 44
- **Win Rate**: 11.36% ❌ **FAILURE**
- **Wins**: 5
- **Losses**: 39
- **Average Win**: +572,050 pips
- **Average Loss**: -191,368 pips
- **Net Result**: -4,603,084 pips
- **Profit Factor**: 0.38

**Status**: ❌ **MASSIVE FAILURE** - Win rate is 38.64% BELOW the 50% threshold

### Analysis

The backtest revealed severe issues with the current strategy configuration:

1. **Extremely Low Win Rate**: 11.36% is catastrophically low - meaning the strategy loses 88.64% of trades
2. **Pip Calculation Issue**: The massive pip values indicate Gold is being calculated incorrectly
3. **Poor Risk/Reward Execution**: Despite having larger wins than losses in pip terms, the low win rate makes the strategy unprofitable
4. **Entry Timing Issues**: The strategy is entering trades at poor moments with high probability of hitting stop loss

### Root Causes

Based on the backtest data:

1. **Overly Aggressive Entry Criteria**:
   - Min ADX: 8.0 (too low - allows weak trends)
   - Min Momentum: 0.0003 (extremely low threshold)
   - Min Quality Score: 10 (far too low)

2. **Stop Loss Positioning**:
   - 2.5 ATR stop loss is reasonable but entries are poor
   - Stops are getting hit on nearly 9 out of 10 trades

3. **Timeframe Mismatch**:
   - 40-period momentum on M5 = 3.3 hours
   - Not long enough to capture the sustained moves we're targeting

4. **Lack of Filters**:
   - No proper trend confirmation
   - Weak quality scoring allowing bad setups
   - Not filtering out choppy/ranging conditions effectively

### Session Quality Breakdown

| Session Quality | Trades | Win Rate | Result |
|-----------------|--------|----------|--------|
| Prime (90-100)  | 23     | 13.04%   | ❌ FAILURE |
| High (70-89)    | 20     | 10.00%   | ❌ FAILURE |
| Medium (50-69)  | 0      | N/A      | N/A |
| Low (0-49)      | 1      | 0.00%    | ❌ FAILURE |

**Even prime trading sessions only achieved 13% win rate** - still 37% below threshold!

## Recommendations for Immediate Action

### 1. STOP TRADING THIS STRATEGY IMMEDIATELY
The current configuration is losing money at an alarming rate. Do not deploy to production.

### 2. Required Parameter Changes

**Increase Entry Thresholds**:
- Min ADX: 8.0 → 25.0 (require strong trends)
- Min Momentum: 0.0003 → 0.005 (require substantial momentum)
- Min Quality Score: 10 → 70 (only trade high-quality setups)

**Improve Trend Confirmation**:
- Add multi-timeframe trend alignment requirement
- Require H1 and H4 to agree with M5 trend
- Only trade pullbacks in established trends, not new trends

**Better Risk Management**:
- Reduce position size until win rate improves
- Consider wider stops (3.0-3.5 ATR) or better entries
- Implement break-even stop once trade moves 1.5 ATR in favor

### 3. Complete Strategy Overhaul Needed

The strategy needs fundamental redesign:
- Focus on trend-following only (no counter-trend)
- Wait for clear pullbacks to EMA in strong trends
- Require RSI oversold/overbought confirmation
- Add volume confirmation (above average volume)
- Filter out low volatility periods

### 4. Alternative Approach

Consider implementing:
- **Strategy 1**: Pure trend-following with strict filters (ADX>30, strong momentum, pullback to 21 EMA)
- **Strategy 2**: Range trading at support/resistance with confirmation
- **Strategy 3**: Breakout trading only after consolidation periods

## Next Steps

1. ❌ **DO NOT DEPLOY** current strategy configuration
2. ✅ Implement emergency parameter changes (increase thresholds)
3. ✅ Run new backtest with stricter parameters
4. ✅ If win rate < 50%, redesign strategy from scratch
5. ✅ Consider using existing proven strategies from other sources

## Conclusion

**The current Trump DNA (Momentum Trading) strategy is fundamentally broken and must not be used for live trading.**

With an 11.36% win rate, this strategy will consistently lose money. Even with the large winners, the profit factor of 0.38 means we're losing $0.62 for every dollar risked.

**Required minimum win rate**: 50%
**Current win rate**: 11.36%
**Gap**: -38.64 percentage points

**Status**: ❌ **CATASTROPHIC FAILURE** - Complete strategy redesign required
