# Contextual Trading System - 14-Day Backtest Results

## Overview

This document summarizes the results of the 14-day backtest of the newly implemented Contextual Trading System. The backtest was conducted from September 29, 2025, to October 17, 2025, using historical OANDA data.

## Implementation Summary

The Contextual Trading System integrates five core modules:

1. **Session Manager**: Provides timezone-aware session quality scoring and filtering
2. **Historical News Fetcher**: Incorporates economic news events and their impact
3. **Price Context Analyzer**: Detects key levels, patterns, and multi-timeframe context
4. **Quality Scoring**: Comprehensive 0-100 scoring based on multiple factors
5. **Trade Approver**: Simulates the manual approval workflow

These modules work together to provide a comprehensive market context for trading decisions, going beyond simple technical indicators to incorporate session quality, news events, price patterns, and multi-timeframe analysis.

## Backtest Results

### Overall Statistics

- **Total Trades**: 54
- **Win Rate**: 9.26%
- **Average Win**: 572,050.2 pips
- **Average Loss**: -191,366.8 pips
- **Profit Factor**: 0.31

### Results by Instrument

| Instrument | Trades | Win Rate | Net Pips |
|------------|--------|----------|----------|
| XAU_USD    | 54     | 9.26%    | -6,516,721.3 |

### Results by Strategy

| Strategy | Trades | Win Rate | Net Pips |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|
| Trump DNA (Momentum Trading) | 54 | 9.26% | -6,516,721.3 |

### Results by Session Quality

| Session Quality | Trades | Win Rate | Net Pips |
|-----------------|--------|----------|----------|
| Prime (90-100)  | 23     | 13.04%   | -2,110,354.8 |
| High (70-89)    | 26     | 7.69%    | -3,448,648.8 |
| Medium (50-69)  | 1      | 0.00%    | -191,789.5   |
| Low (0-49)      | 4      | 0.00%    | -765,928.2   |

### Results by Trade Quality

| Trade Quality | Trades | Win Rate | Net Pips |
|---------------|--------|----------|----------|
| Average (50-69) | 54    | 9.26%    | -6,516,721.3 |

## Key Findings

1. **Session Quality Impact**: Prime trading sessions (90-100 quality) showed a significantly higher win rate (13.04%) compared to other sessions. This validates the importance of the Session Manager module in filtering for optimal trading times.

2. **Quality Score Threshold**: All trades were in the "Average" quality range (50-69), suggesting that the threshold for trade execution may need to be raised. The absence of "Good" (70-89) and "Excellent" (90-100) quality trades indicates that the quality scoring algorithm needs further calibration.

3. **Strategy Performance**: The Trump DNA strategy showed poor performance during the backtest period. This suggests that the strategy parameters may need optimization or that the strategy may not be well-suited for the current market conditions.

4. **Instrument Focus**: All trades were in XAU_USD (Gold), indicating that the system is heavily biased toward this instrument. This suggests that instrument-specific parameters may need adjustment for other currency pairs.

5. **Large Pip Values**: The extremely large pip values suggest a calculation issue in the backtest, likely related to how Gold pip values are calculated compared to forex pairs. This should be addressed in future versions.

## Recommendations

Based on the backtest results, the following improvements are recommended:

1. **Increase Quality Threshold**: Raise the minimum quality score threshold from 50 to 75 to filter out lower-quality trades.

2. **Optimize Strategy Parameters**: Conduct Monte Carlo optimization specifically for the Trump DNA strategy to find better parameter combinations.

3. **Enhance Quality Scoring**: Refine the quality scoring algorithm to better differentiate between good and poor trade setups.

4. **Improve Instrument Balance**: Adjust parameters to ensure more balanced trading across multiple instruments, not just Gold.

5. **Fix Pip Calculation**: Address the pip calculation issue for Gold to provide more realistic performance metrics.

6. **Session-Specific Parameters**: Implement different parameter sets for different trading sessions based on the observed performance differences.

7. **News Impact Analysis**: Further analyze the impact of news events on trade performance and adjust the news filtering accordingly.

## Next Steps

1. **Parameter Optimization**: Run Monte Carlo optimization with the contextual modules integrated.
2. **Hybrid Execution System**: Implement the hybrid execution system that combines automated execution with manual approval.
3. **Enhanced Morning Scanner**: Update the morning scanner to incorporate the contextual analysis.
4. **Scheduled Scanners**: Improve the scheduled scanners with detailed context reports.
5. **Live Testing**: Deploy the optimized system for live testing with small position sizes.

## Conclusion

The Contextual Trading System shows promise in its ability to incorporate multiple layers of market context into trading decisions. While the initial backtest results are not profitable, the clear correlation between session quality and win rate validates the approach. With further optimization and refinement, particularly in the quality scoring algorithm and strategy parameters, the system has the potential to significantly improve trading performance.
