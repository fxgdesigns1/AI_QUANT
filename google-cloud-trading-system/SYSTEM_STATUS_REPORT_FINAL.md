## ⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUE: SCANNER NOT RUNNING**

### Problem:
The system is **monitoring accounts** but **NOT actively scanning for trades**.

**What IS Working:**
- ✅ Connects to accounts every minute
- ✅ Retrieves balances
- ✅ Displays on dashboard
- ✅ WebSocket updates

**What is NOT Working:**
- ❌ Strategy scanning not running
- ❌ No signal generation
- ❌ No trade execution
- ❌ No candle-based analysis

### Evidence from Logs:
```
✅ INFO: Connecting to account 011
✅ INFO: Live data retrieved: $123,831.68
❌ NO: Scanner initialization logs
❌ NO: "NEW CANDLE SCAN" messages
❌ NO: Strategy analysis logs
❌ NO: Signal generation logs
```

---

## 🔧 **ROOT CAUSE**

The deployed version (`20251005t235716`) does **NOT** include the trading scanner initialization code.

**Reason:** The fix I added to `main.py` (lines 80-97) failed to deploy due to cloud build error:
```
ERROR: Cloud build 18f4e2d1-def9-4655-9636-15b05083eadd status: FAILURE
Failed to download at least one file. Cannot continue.
```

---

## 🚀 **SOLUTION OPTIONS**

### Option 1: Retry Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/mac/quant_system_clean/google-cloud-trading-system
gcloud app deploy --quiet
```

### Option 2: Manual Scanner Start via SSH
Connect to instance and manually start scanner

### Option 3: Wait for Automatic Scanner
Some versions may have cron jobs that start scanner periodically

---

## 📋 **CURRENT SYSTEM BEHAVIOR**

### Every 60 Seconds:
1. ✅ System fetches OANDA data
2. ✅ Connects to all 4 accounts
3. ✅ Retrieves account balances
4. ✅ Updates dashboard with latest balances
5. ❌ **Does NOT run strategy analysis**
6. ❌ **Does NOT generate signals**
7. ❌ **Does NOT execute trades**

### What Should Happen Every 5 Minutes:
1. Scanner detects new candle
2. Runs all 4 strategies
3. Analyzes market conditions
4. Generates signals if conditions met
5. Executes trades automatically
6. Sends Telegram notifications
