# üéØ Trade Quality Filter System

## Overview
The Trade Quality Filter is a multi-layer scoring system that evaluates each trade signal across 7 independent dimensions. Only trades that score above the minimum threshold are executed.

**Goal:** Trade less, win more, profit more.

## üîß How to Use

### In Your Strategy:
```python
from src.core.trade_quality_filter import TradeQualityFilter

# Initialize filter
quality_filter = TradeQualityFilter(min_quality_score=85)

# Evaluate each signal
should_take, score, breakdown = quality_filter.evaluate_trade_quality(
    signal=trade_signal,
    market_data=current_market_data,
    strategy_metadata=strategy_metadata
)

if should_take:
    # Execute trade
    execute_trade(signal)
    quality_filter.add_active_trade(signal)
else:
    # Skip trade
    logger.info(f"Trade filtered out - Score: {score}/100")
```

## üìà Expected Improvements

### Before Quality Filter:
- **Trades**: 31 per 14 days (~15.5/week)
- **Win Rate**: 41.9%

## üéì Best Practices

1. **Start Conservative** (85 threshold) and gradually lower if needed
2. **Track Results** - Monitor which filters reject most trades
3. **Adjust Per Instrument** - Some pairs may need different thresholds
4. **Session Awareness** - Don't force trades outside peak sessions
5. **Trust the System** - If score is below threshold, skip the trade

---

## üî¨ Testing & Optimization

Run the quality threshold optimizer to find your optimal setting:

```bash
cd google-cloud-trading-system
python3 quality_threshold_optimizer.py
```

This will test thresholds from 50-95 and recommend the optimal balance for your strategy.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **This is NOT a standalone strategy** - it's a filter layer on top of your existing strategies
- **Requires good base strategy** - Garbage in = garbage out
- **Backtesting recommended** - Test on historical data before live trading
- **May reduce opportunities** - Fewer trades = more patience required
- **FTMO-friendly** - Helps meet win rate requirements for prop firms

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Run `quality_threshold_optimizer.py` to find your optimal threshold
2. Integrate `TradeQualityFilter` into your main trading system
3. Backtest with 30 days of data
4. Start with paper trading to validate
5. Go live with small position sizes
6. Scale up as confidence grows

**Remember:** Quality over quantity. It's better to take 1 great trade per week than 10 mediocre ones.
