## Deployment Process

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Set environment variables
export PROJECT_ID=quant-trading-system
export VERSION=v1-contextual
export REGION=us-central1

# Authenticate with Google Cloud
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
```

### 2. Pre-Deployment Validation
```bash
# Run validation script
python pre_deploy_check.py

# If validation fails, fix issues and re-run
```

### 3. Backup Current System
```bash
# Create backup of current deployment
gcloud app versions list
gcloud app versions clone [CURRENT_VERSION] --version=$VERSION-backup

# Backup configuration files
cp app.yaml app.yaml.backup
cp cron.yaml cron.yaml.backup
```

### 4. Deploy New Version
```bash
# Deploy to App Engine
gcloud app deploy app.yaml --version=$VERSION --no-promote

# Deploy cron jobs
gcloud app deploy cron.yaml
```

### 5. Verification
```bash
# Check new version
gcloud app versions describe $VERSION

# Run smoke test
python verify_deployment.py --version=$VERSION

# Check logs for errors
gcloud app logs tail --version=$VERSION
```

### 6. Traffic Migration
```bash
# Migrate 10% of traffic to new version
gcloud app services set-traffic default --splits=$VERSION=0.1,[CURRENT_VERSION]=0.9

# Monitor for 30 minutes
python monitor_deployment.py --version=$VERSION --duration=30

# If stable, migrate 50% of traffic
gcloud app services set-traffic default --splits=$VERSION=0.5,[CURRENT_VERSION]=0.5

# Monitor for 30 minutes
python monitor_deployment.py --version=$VERSION --duration=30

# If stable, migrate 100% of traffic
gcloud app services set-traffic default --splits=$VERSION=1.0
```

### 7. Post-Deployment
```bash
# Send system status update to Telegram
python send_deployment_notification.py

# Start monitoring system
python monitor_system.py
```

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are detected during deployment, follow these steps to rollback:

```bash
# Rollback to previous version
gcloud app services set-traffic default --splits=[PREVIOUS_VERSION]=1.0

# Restore configuration files
cp app.yaml.backup app.yaml
cp cron.yaml.backup cron.yaml

# Send rollback notification
python send_rollback_notification.py
```

## Monitoring Plan

### 1. Short-term Monitoring (First 24 Hours)
- Monitor system logs every hour
- Verify trade signals are being generated correctly
- Check Telegram notifications are being sent
- Verify trade execution and approval workflow

### 2. Medium-term Monitoring (First Week)
- Daily review of system performance
- Compare actual vs. expected number of trade signals
- Analyze quality scores distribution
- Check session awareness is working correctly

### 3. Long-term Monitoring (Ongoing)
- Weekly performance review
- Monthly parameter optimization
- Quarterly system architecture review

## Success Criteria

The deployment will be considered successful if:

1. System generates appropriate number of trade signals (3-7 per day)
2. Quality scoring effectively filters low-quality setups
3. Session awareness correctly identifies optimal trading times
4. Telegram notifications are clear and actionable
5. Trade approval workflow functions correctly
6. No critical errors in system logs

## Contingency Plan

If the system does not meet success criteria after one week:

1. Analyze root causes of issues
2. Develop targeted fixes for specific problems
3. If major issues persist, consider reverting to previous system
4. Schedule comprehensive review of system architecture
