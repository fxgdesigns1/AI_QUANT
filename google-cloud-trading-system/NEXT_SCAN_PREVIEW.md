## 🎯 What Happens Step-by-Step

### STEP 1: Cron Trigger (0 seconds)
```
Google Cloud Scheduler → POST /tasks/full_scan
```
✅ Automatic, no action needed

### STEP 2: System Initialization (1-2 seconds)
```
Loading...
✅ Account 009 connected (Gold Scalping)
✅ Account 010 connected (Ultra Strict Forex)
✅ Account 011 connected (Momentum Trading)
✅ Live data feed started
✅ Telegram notifier ready
```

### STEP 3: First Scan - Normal Criteria (3-5 seconds)
```
Scanning Account 009...
  • Looking for gold opportunities
  • Min confidence: 40%
  • Stop loss: 8 pips, Take profit: 12 pips
  
Scanning Account 010...
  • Looking for forex opportunities
  • Min confidence: 30%
  • Stop loss: 0.5%, Take profit: 0.8%
  
Scanning Account 011...
  • Looking for momentum opportunities
  • Min ADX: 10, Min momentum: 0.1
  • Stop loss: 1.5 ATR, Take profit: 2.5 ATR
```

**Outcome A:** ✅ Found 5+ opportunities → Execute trades → Skip to Step 5

**Outcome B:** ⚠️ Found 0-2 opportunities → Continue to Step 4

### STEP 4: Progressive Relaxation (Only if needed)
```
🔄 No trades found with normal criteria...
🔄 Attempting progressive relaxation...

LEVEL 1 (Attempt 1):
  • Reduce confidence to 20%
  • Widen SL to 0.8%, TP to 1.2%
  • Force minimum trades: 3 (Gold), 10 (Forex), 5 (Momentum)
  
  Result: Looking for trades...
```

**If still no trades:**
```
LEVEL 2 (Attempt 2):
  • Reduce confidence to 10%
  • Widen SL to 1.2%, TP to 1.8%
  • More aggressive forced entry
  
  Result: Looking for trades...
```

**If STILL no trades:**
```
LEVEL 3 (Attempt 3):
  • Reduce confidence to 5%
  • Widen SL to 1.5%, TP to 2.5%
  • Maximum relaxation - WILL find something
```

### STEP 5: Trade Execution (1-2 seconds per trade)
```
For EACH opportunity found:

1. Calculate position size
   Account 009: 7,500 units (0.075 lots = $600 risk)
   Account 010: 100,000 units (1.0 lots = $500 risk)
   Account 011: 100,000 units (1.0 lots = $500 risk)

2. Validate trade
   ✅ Check account balance
   ✅ Check position limits
   ✅ Check risk limits

3. Execute MARKET order
   ✅ Place order with OANDA
   ✅ Attach Stop Loss (automatic)
   ✅ Attach Take Profit (automatic)

4. Confirm execution

   ✅ Update account status
```

### STEP 6: Telegram Notification (1 second)
