    from src.core.candle_based_scanner import get_candle_scanner
    scanner = get_candle_scanner()
    
    # Start scanning in background thread
    scan_thread = threading.Thread(target=scanner.start_scanning, daemon=True)
    scan_thread.start()
    
    logger.info("✅ Trading scanner initialized and started")
    logger.info(f"✅ Active strategies: {list(scanner.strategies.keys())}")
    logger.info(f"✅ Account mappings: {scanner.accounts}")
