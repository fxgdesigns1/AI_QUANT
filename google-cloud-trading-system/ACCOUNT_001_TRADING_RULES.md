## 🚨 MISTAKES TO NEVER REPEAT

### October 8, 2025 - Counter-Trend SHORT Trade

**What happened:**
- ❌ Entered SHORT at $4,030.99
- ❌ Contradicted BULLISH strategy
- ❌ Was compensating for missed trades
- ❌ Panic/chasing behavior
- ❌ Result: -£1,080 loss

**Why it was wrong:**
1. Strategy said BULLISH → Went BEARISH
2. Strategy said "buy dips" → Shorted the top
3. Was compensating for errors → Emotional trading
4. Ignored own analysis → Chased market

**Lesson:**
**NEVER trade counter to the strategy. NEVER compensate for mistakes with more trades.**

## ✅ CORRECT TRADING BEHAVIOR

### Example 1: Proper LONG Entry
```
Price: $3,990 (dip)
Action: Enter LONG 300 units
Entry: $3,990
Stop Loss: $3,975 (-$15 risk)
Take Profit: $4,040 (+$50 reward)
R:R: 1:3.3
✅ CORRECT - Aligned with strategy
```

### Example 2: Waiting for Setup
```
Price: $4,040 (all-time high)
Action: WAIT
Reason: Too high, outside entry zone
Next Action: Wait for dip to $4,000-$4,010
✅ CORRECT - Patient, disciplined
```

### Example 3: Adding to Winner
```
Position 1: LONG from $3,990 (+$30 profit)
Price: $4,010 (small dip)
Action: Add LONG 300 units
Total: 600 units LONG
✅ CORRECT - Adding to winning direction
```

## ❌ INCORRECT TRADING BEHAVIOR

### Example 1: Counter-Trend SHORT (Oct 8 mistake)
```
Price: $4,031 (near highs)
Action: SHORT 300 units ❌
Reason: "Too high, expecting pullback" ❌
Result: Lost £1,080 ❌
✅ WRONG - Contradicted BULLISH strategy
```

### Example 2: Chasing High
```
Price: $4,050 (all-time high)
Action: LONG 300 units ❌
Reason: "FOMO, don't want to miss it" ❌
✅ WRONG - Outside entry zone, chasing
```

### Example 3: No Stop Loss
```
Action: LONG 300 units without SL ❌
Reason: "Will manage manually" ❌
