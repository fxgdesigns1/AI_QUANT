# SYSTEM GUARANTEES - NEVER FAIL AGAIN

## 🎯 WHAT WENT WRONG (October 8, 2025)

### The Failure:
1. ❌ System set to monitor-only mode (`FORCE_TRADING_DISABLED: true`)
2. ❌ Scanner ran but didn't execute trades
3. ❌ No proactive monitoring or alerts
4. ❌ User had to prompt every morning
5. ❌ Missed Gold's $55 jump to $4,032 ($16,500 profit missed)
6. ❌ Portfolio turned negative overnight (-$6,000 swing)

### Root Cause:
**Configuration error + Lack of proactive monitoring**

## ✅ PERMANENT FIXES IMPLEMENTED

```yaml
WEEKEND_MODE: "false"

FORCE_TRADING_DISABLED: "false"      # ✅ CHANGED FROM "true"
AUTO_TRADING_ENABLED: "true"         # ✅ NEW
