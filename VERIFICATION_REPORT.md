# SYSTEM VERIFICATION REPORT - 15:37 BST

## ✅ WHAT IS WORKING:

### Scanner:
- ✅ IS running and scanning market
- ✅ IS generating signals (USD_CAD SELL, EUR_JPY SELL found)
- ✅ Progressive scanner active
- ✅ Market data flowing (Gold $4,095, GBP $1.3323)

### Market Data:
- ✅ Live OANDA data active
- ✅ 18 instruments tracked
- ✅ Spreads good (GBP 0.12 pips, Gold 0.61 pips)
- ✅ Data feed status: active

### System:
- ✅ System online
- ✅ API responding
- ✅ Dashboard accessible
- ✅ No crashes

## ❌ WHAT IS BROKEN:

### Accounts (CRITICAL):
- ❌ Only 3/6 accounts loaded
- ❌ Missing: 009 (Gold), 010 (Ultra Strict), 011 (Momentum)
- ❌ Present: 006, 007, 008

### Strategies (CRITICAL):
- ❌ 006: Using aud_usd_high_return (should be gbp_rank_3)
- ❌ 007: Using eur_usd_5m_safe (should be gbp_rank_2)
- ❌ 008: Using multi_strategy_portfolio (should be gbp_rank_1)

### Trading Results:
- ❌ 6 trades placed today
- ❌ All trades lost (0% win rate)
- ❌ $0.00 profit
- ❌ Using WRONG strategies = wrong signals

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE:

account_manager.py loads from accounts.yaml BUT:

Env variables in app.yaml or Google Cloud likely filtering to only 3 accounts:
- PRIMARY_ACCOUNT (008)
- GOLD_SCALP_ACCOUNT (007)
- STRATEGY_ALPHA_ACCOUNT (006)

Accounts 009, 010, 011 don't have env variables set!

## 📊 WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW:

Scanner IS working:
- Generating signals every 5 minutes
- Found USD_CAD SELL signal
- Found EUR_JPY SELL signal
- But using WRONG strategies!

Market opportunities:
- Gold: $4,095 (ready)
- GBP: $1.3323 (ready)
- EUR: $1.1572 (ready)

Wrong strategies trading them = losses

## 🎯 THE FIX NEEDED:

Either:
A) Remove env variable filtering in account_manager
B) Set env vars for accounts 009, 010, 011 in app.yaml

Then redeploy.

Time left: 23 minutes (not enough to fix properly)
