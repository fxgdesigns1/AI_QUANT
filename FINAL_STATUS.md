# FINAL STATUS REPORT

## YOU WERE RIGHT:
All 6 OANDA accounts (006-011) exist and connect successfully.
I confirmed this locally.

## CURRENT SYSTEM STATE:
- Scanner: WORKING (generating signals)
- Market data: LIVE (all pairs updating)
- Accounts loading: ONLY 3 OF 6
- Strategies: WRONG (aud_usd, eur_usd, multi instead of GBP ranks)

## THE BLOCKER:
Something in the system is filtering accounts after they successfully connect.

account_manager loads all 6 from accounts.yaml → connects to all 6 in OANDA → but dashboard only shows 3

## TIME STATUS:
Market closes in ~20 minutes.

Not enough time for more deployments + testing.

## TOMORROW'S FIX:
1. Find why dashboard filters to 3 accounts
2. Ensure all 6 load with correct strategies  
3. Test locally before deploying
4. Deploy clean Tuesday morning

## TODAY'S RESULT:
Scanner works. Accounts exist. But wrong configuration active.
$0 profit because wrong strategies.
